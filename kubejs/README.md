# Contributing to Translation Files
We welcome any player to contribute to our translation files. Here are some instructions.
## Folder Structure
Each folder in this folder represent a mod and named after modid. Before contributing to these files, please check out that coresponding mod does NOT contains your language, and always consider contributing to the original mod first.  

These following folders are related to our project:
1. `ponderjs_generated/lang` is our own ponder translation folder.
2. `kubejs/lang` is items, fluid and tooltip translation folder.
3. `the_winter_rescue/lang` is hints and advancements translation folder.
4. `tips/lang` is in-game tips translation folder.
5. `twr_quests/lang` is quest book translation folder.
6. `diet/lang` is diet language and our custom diet group translation folder, __do not contribute this to Diet Mod__.    

You are welcomed to contribute to these folders. 
## Contributing
You can do the translations on your local path, Just copy `en_us.json` or `zh_cn.json` and modify to your own language. If you finished, just make a pull-request to our project and we would review and merge asap.  
You can use any tool or editor if you like, just keep the json file pretty formatted so anyone else could easily edit it.  
If you find something wrong or inproper, feel free to send issue(Question) including correct translation or prs to us, we would review and change asap.
## Reminders
- Please DO NOT change or translate any folder name.   
- You should keep file extensions the same with the original file name. Such as, Source file is `en_us.json` and translated file should be name after `<locale code>.json`.
- If you want to leave a blank text, do NOT just leave it empty or delete it, fill a space inside. 
 
Above are essential rules. __Not following these rules would cause your files INVALID and NOT being able to take effect!__

Also, we recommend to follow these rules:
- Test your translations in your own game before uploading to ensure no language problem or file syntax error.
- You should state What you have done in commit message or pull-request message, so that we could easily review and merge. 
  
Following these rules would make our work easier.  
__Thank you for your cooperation.__
