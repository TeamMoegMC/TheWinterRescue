Clauses that apply in general to any of the uses that follow.
- Personal Permission Clause
  TeamMoeg will not give personal permission unless TeamMoeg knows the person asking or there's a really good reason for it, as giving personal permission implies endorsement. Asking for personal permission will likely just end up having you ignored or redirected back to this license.
- Waive Clause
  All restrictive clauses in this license can be ignored with personal permission. Read the above clause.
- Extensive Clause
  This license applies to The Winter Rescue, the The Winter Rescue website, the The Winter Rescue Wiki and all other code, assets or binaries found on this website or the github repository unless otherwise indicated.

3. If you want to Distribute The Winter Rescue
- Attribution Clause
  You must give appropriate credit to TeamMoeg as the creator of The Winter Rescue or the parts of it you're using. If you do any alterations the fact that you do so should also be indicated. A link back is optional but it would be cool if you would do so.
- Non-Monetary Clause
  You may not charge for access to the distribution itself or gain money through it, this includes any type of inline advertisement, such as url shorteners (adf.ly or otherwise) or ads in your service slowing the download down. This includes restricting any amount of access behind a paywall.

4. If you want to Host a Server with The Winter Rescue
- No In-game Charging Clause
  You may not charge for in-game goods that break gaming balance such as mod items, special abilities, or cosmetic features on a public server that runs the Modpack. By public server, we mean posting server ip address on a public accessible location directly or indirectly, either on or off the internet. Breaking this rule may result in we asking you or related administration to prevent your server ip from being public accessible until you stop the behavior.
- Whitelisting Clause
  Charging money from whitelisted players is totally fine.
- Donation Clause
  Raising money from donation (no in-game reward) is totally fine.
- Private Server Clause
  Non-public servers do not need to follow the first clause in this section.

5. If you want to Feature The Winter Rescue
- Thief Clause
  You must not claim that you made The Winter Rescue. Giving appropriate credit to TeamMoeg as the creator of The Winter Rescue makes you cooler, but you don't have to do it if you don't want to.

6. If you want to Use The Winter Rescue's Code or Assets
Usage of code or assets falls under the Extensive Clause.
- Attribution Clause
  You must give appropriate credit to TeamMoeg as the creator of The Winter Rescue or the parts of it you're using. If you do any alterations the fact that you do so should also be indicated. A link back is optional but it would be cool if you would do so.
